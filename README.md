# FlavourSphere: Where Every Recipe Tells a Story and Every Meal Makes a Difference

## Project Overview
FlavourSphere is a platform designed to foster community engagement through food donation, recipe sharing, and culinary discussions. By providing a centralized space for individuals and non-profit organizations, FlavourSphere aims to reduce food waste, support those in need, and celebrate diverse culinary traditions. The platform leverages modern web development technologies to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Problem Statement
Despite the abundance of surplus food and individuals willing to donate, many communities still face food insecurity. There is a lack of centralized platforms to connect donors with recipients efficiently. Additionally, valuable culinary knowledge and recipes often remain untapped, which could otherwise help reduce food waste and promote healthy eating habits.
